## CVI Dash Dashboard 

Repository for developing the Dash implementation of our COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index dashboard.

# Updates:
**Visual components:**

- Choropleth map of 3 primary scores (COVID severity, economic harm, and mobile health)
- Choropleth maps of all underlying variables in the base dataset (listed here)
- Bar graph of 10 counties with highest COVID case counts

**Users can :**

- Select which scores and/or underlying variables they want the map to display
- Adjust display area of the map
- Hover over a county on the map to see key statistics (county and state name, scores)
- Select a specific state and/or county (zoom to the location and display information)

# Next steps:
- Legends for all choropleth maps
- List of highest scoring counties for each metric (can be a single list widget where you select which score to show)
- Side bar prominently displaying brief descriptions of each scores (including variables used to construct them) and instructions on how to use the dashboard)
- Users can see demographic information of a county on the hoverboard
- Users can choose multiple indicators to visualize at the same time
- Users can find their current location and display score information
- Integrate all features described above into a single Dash dashboard instance that can be hosted elsewhere
